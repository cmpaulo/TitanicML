# TitanicML
This is a machine learning sample to find out who survived the Titanic crash in python with sklearn linear regression

Version 3:
In this version I introduce machine learning without exploratory data analysis and considering missing values as -1.
I use a linear regression model for machine learning with the training data and use the test data to make the prediction. This is a [kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/laudiomachadopaulo/titanic-model-1), where kaggle reports that the score of this machine learning model was 0.77.
